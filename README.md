# GT3CourseIPICEditor
A tool for editing the course.ipic archive files found inside GT3. All code is generated by ChatGPT, using research on the file format by me.
Course.ipic is an archive file that GT3 uses to store screenshots of the first frame of the Arcade mode FMV's. The purpose is to display a still image to the screen before the game has finished loading the FMV.
The ability to edit the file is crucial, as if new courses are added to Arcade mode, when you leave an event in a new course, the game will freeze. This happens because normally in the menus, if the game cannot load a new still image, it will instead use the previous loaded one. This memory is cleared when you enter an event, and so it fails to display anything & freezes the game.

Usage:
