# GT3CourseIPICEditor
A tool for editing the course.ipic archive files found inside GT3. All code is generated by ChatGPT, using research on the file format by me.
Course.ipic is an archive file that GT3 uses to store screenshots of the first frame of the Arcade mode FMV's. The purpose is to display a still image to the screen before the game has finished loading the FMV.
The ability to edit the file is crucial, as if new courses are added to Arcade mode, when you leave an event in a new course, the game will freeze. This happens because normally in the menus, if the game cannot load a new still image, it will instead use the previous loaded one. This memory is cleared when you enter an event, and so it fails to display anything & freezes the game.
The utility may also work on GT4's IPIC files, though I have not tested it. The files do appear to be in the same format though.

Usage:
````
Building an archive:
GT3CourseIPICEditor.exe or simply running the executable. The utility will assume the extracted image data exists in a folder in the same directory as the executable.

Extracting an archive:
GT3CourseIPICEditor.exe course.ipic (path to file)
